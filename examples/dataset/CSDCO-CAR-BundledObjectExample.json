There are X m of core analyzed from CARL_HRMS, Y m of core analyzed from 1001_HRMS_1A and Z m of core analyzed fromf 1001_HRMS_1B. Age of sampled sediment is YYYYY.  Cored material is mud and sandy silt, with sparse organic rich layers. Magnetic susceptibility was measured at 0.5 cm intervals. Image resolution is approximately 0.XXX mm, or YYY DPI. Analyses were done with XXXXX susceptibility sensor, and images were made with a yyyyy camera. . Packaged file generated by Corelyzer software that contains all core images and data for the project, allowing simplest setup of project datasets in Corelyzer. CAR is a zip archive that contains a data directory with XML data files produced by core scan, and an image directory that contains jpg image files of visual core scans. Scanned images are matched to data in xml file based on the section/id element in the xml matching the file name of a scanned image (without the file extension).
