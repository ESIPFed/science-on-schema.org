quantitykind:Action	Action	An action is usually an integral over time. But for action pertaining to fields, it may be integrated over spatial variables as well. In some cases, the action is integrated along the path followed by the physical system.  If the action is represented as an integral over time, taken a the path of the system between the initial time and the final time of the development of the system.  The evolution of a physical system between two states is determined by requiring the action be minimized or, more generally, be stationary for small perturbations about the true evolution. This requirement leads to differential equations that describe the true evolution. Conversely, an action principle is a method for reformulating differential equations of motion for a physical system as an equivalent integral equation. Although several variants have been defined (see below), the most commonly used action principle is Hamilton's principle.	http://qudt.org/vocab/unit/J-SEC

quantitykind:Curvature	Curvature	The canonical example of extrinsic curvature is that of a circle, which has curvature equal to the inverse of its radius everywhere. Smaller circles bend more sharply, and hence have higher curvature. The curvature of a smooth curve is defined as the curvature of its osculating circle at each point. The osculating circle of a sufficiently smooth plane curve at a given point on the curve is the circle whose center lies on the inner normal line and whose curvature is the same as that of the given curve at that point. This circle is tangent to the curve at the given point.  That is, given a point P on a smooth curve C, the curvature of C at P is defined to be 1/R where R is the radius of the osculating circle of C at P. The magnitude of curvature at points on physical curves can be measured in diopters (also spelled dioptre) — this is the convention in optics. [Wikipedia],	http://qudt.org/vocab/unit/DIOPTER
quantitykind:CurvatureFromRadius	Curvature	In mathematics "Curvature" is the amount by which a geometric object deviates from being flat, or straight in the case of a line, but this is defined in different ways depending on the context.	http://qudt.org/vocab/unit/PER-M
quantitykind:DataRate	Data Rate	The frequency derived from the period of time required to transmit one bit. This represents the amount of data transferred per second by a communications channel or a computing or storage device.

When applied to data rate, the multiplier prefixes "kilo-", "mega-", "giga-", etc. (and their abbreviations, "k", "M", "G", etc.) always denote powers of 1000. For example, 64 kbps is 64,000 bits per second. This contrasts with units of storage which use different prefixes to denote multiplication by powers of 1024, for example 1 kibibit = 1024 bits.	http://qudt.org/vocab/unit/MegaBIT-PER-SEC http://qudt.org/vocab/unit/KiloBIT-PER-SEC

quantitykind:TotalAtomicStoppingPower	Total Atomic Stopping Power	The "Total Atomic Stopping Power" for an ionizing particle passing through an element, is the particle's energy loss per atom within a unit area normal to the particle's path; equal to the linear energy transfer (energy loss per unit path length) divided by the number of atoms per unit volume.	http://qudt.org/vocab/unit/J-M2
quantitykind:TotalCross-Section	Total Cross-section	"Total Cross-section" is related to the absorbance of the light intensity through Beer-Lambert's law. It is the sum of all cross-sections corresponding to the various reactions or processes between an incident particle of specified type and energy and a target particle.	http://qudt.org/vocab/unit/M2
quantitykind:TotalCurrent	Total Current	"Total Current" is the sum of the electric current that is flowing through a surface and the displacement current.	http://qudt.org/vocab/unit/A
quantitykind:TotalCurrentDensity	Total Current Density	"Total Current Density" is the sum of the electric current density and the displacement current density.	http://qudt.org/vocab/unit/A-PER-M2
quantitykind:TotalLinearStoppingPower	Total Linear Stopping Power	The "Total Linear Stopping Power" is defined as the average energy loss of the particle per unit path length.	http://qudt.org/vocab/unit/J-PER-M
quantitykind:TotalMassStoppingPower	Total Mass Stopping Power	If a substance is compared in gaseous and solid form, then the linear stopping powers of the two states are very different just because of the different density. One therefore often divides S(E) by the density of the material to obtain the "Mass Stopping Power". The mass stopping power then depends only very little on the density of the material.	http://qudt.org/vocab/unit/J-M2-PER-KiloGM
quantitykind:Transmittance	Transmittance	Transmittance is the fraction of incident light (electromagnetic radiation) at a specified wavelength that passes through a sample.	http://qudt.org/vocab/unit/UNITLESS
quantitykind:TransmittanceDensity	Transmittance Density	Transmittance is the fraction of incident light (electromagnetic radiation) at a specified wavelength that passes through a sample.	http://qudt.org/vocab/unit/UNITLESS
quantitykind:Turbidity	Turbidity	Turbidity is the cloudiness or haziness of a fluid, or of air, caused by individual particles (suspended solids) that are generally invisible to the naked eye, similar to smoke in air. Turbidity in open water is often caused by phytoplankton and the measurement of turbidity is a key test of water quality. The higher the turbidity, the higher the risk of the drinkers developing gastrointestinal diseases, especially for immune-compromised people, because contaminants like virus or bacteria can become attached to the suspended solid. The suspended solids interfere with water disinfection with chlorine because the particles act as shields for the virus and bacteria. Similarly suspended solids can protect bacteria from UV sterilisation of water. Fluids can contain suspended solid matter consisting of particles of many different sizes. While some suspended material will be large enough and heavy enough to settle rapidly to the bottom container if a liquid sample is left to stand (the settleable solids), very small particles will settle only very slowly or not at all if the sample is regularly agitated or the particles are colloidal. These small solid particles cause the liquid to appear turbid.	http://qudt.org/vocab/unit/NTU
quantitykind:Turns	Turns	"Turns" is the number of turns in a winding.	http://qudt.org/vocab/unit/UNITLESS
quantitykind:VideoFrameRate	Video Frame Rate	Frame rate (also known as frame frequency) is the frequency (rate) at which an imaging device produces unique consecutive images called frames. The term applies equally well to computer graphics, video cameras, film cameras, and motion capture systems. Frame rate is most often expressed in frames per second (FPS) and is also expressed in progressive scan monitors as hertz (Hz).	http://qudt.org/vocab/unit/FRAME-PER-SEC
quantitykind:VisibleRadiantEnergy	Visible Radiant Energy	"Visible Radiant Energy", also known as luminous energy, is the energy of electromagnetic waves. It is energy of the particles that are emitted, transferred, or received as radiation.	http://qudt.org/vocab/unit/J
quantitykind:Volume	Volume	The volume of a solid object is the three-dimensional concept of how much space it occupies, often quantified numerically. One-dimensional figures (such as lines) and two-dimensional shapes (such as squares) are assigned zero volume in the three-dimensional space.	http://qudt.org/vocab/unit/MI3 http://qudt.org/vocab/unit/CentiM3 http://qudt.org/vocab/unit/TBSP http://qudt.org/vocab/unit/MilliM3 http://qudt.org/vocab/unit/AC-FT http://qudt.org/vocab/unit/BBL http://qudt.org/vocab/unit/RT http://qudt.org/vocab/unit/IN3 http://qudt.org/vocab/unit/TSP http://qudt.org/vocab/unit/M3 http://qudt.org/vocab/unit/FBM http://qudt.org/vocab/unit/PINT http://qudt.org/vocab/unit/QT http://qudt.org/vocab/unit/STR http://qudt.org/vocab/unit/PlanckVolume http://qudt.org/vocab/unit/FT3 http://qudt.org/vocab/unit/YD3
quantitykind:VolumeFlowRate	Volume Flow Rate	Volumetric Flow Rate, (also known as volume flow rate, rate of fluid flow or volume velocity) is the volume of fluid which passes through a given surface per unit time.	http://qudt.org/vocab/unit/M3-PER-SEC
quantitykind:VolumeFraction	Volume Fraction	"Volume Fraction" is the volume of a constituent divided by the volume of all constituents of the mixture prior to mixing. Volume fraction is also called volume concentration in ideal solutions where the volumes of the constituents are additive (the volume of the solution is equal to the sum of the volumes of its ingredients).	http://qudt.org/vocab/unit/UNITLESS
quantitykind:VolumeThermalExpansion	Volume Thermal Expansion	When the temperature of a substance changes, the energy that is stored in the intermolecular bonds between atoms changes. When the stored energy increases, so does the length of the molecular bonds. As a result, solids typically expand in response to heating and contract on cooling; this dimensional response to temperature change is expressed by its coefficient of thermal expansion.    Different coefficients of thermal expansion can be defined for a substance depending on whether the expansion is measured by:        * linear thermal expansion      * area thermal expansion      * volumetric thermal expansion    These characteristics are closely related. The volumetric thermal expansion coefficient can be defined for both liquids and solids. The linear thermal expansion can only be defined for solids, and is common in engineering applications.    Some substances expand when cooled, such as freezing water, so they have negative thermal expansion coefficients. [Wikipedia]	http://qudt.org/vocab/unit/M3-PER-K
quantitykind:VolumetricHeatCapacity	Volumetric Heat Capacity	"Volumetric Heat Capacity (VHC)}, also termed \textit{volume-specific heat capacity}, describes the ability of a given volume of a substance to store internal energy while undergoing a given temperature change, but without undergoing a phase transition. It is different from specific heat capacity in that the VHC is a \textit{per unit volume} measure of the relationship between thermal energy and temperature of a material, while the specific heat is a \textit{per unit mass" measure (or occasionally per molar quantity of the material).	http://qudt.org/vocab/unit/J-PER-M3-K
quantitykind:Wavelength	Wavelength	For a monochromatic wave, "wavelength" is the distance between two successive points in a direction perpendicular to the wavefront where at a given instant the phase differs by \(2\pi\). The wavelength of a sinusoidal wave is the spatial period of the wave—the distance over which the wave's shape repeats. The SI unit of wavelength is the meter.	http://qudt.org/vocab/unit/M
quantitykind:Wavenumber	Wavenumber	"Wavenumber" is the spatial frequency of a wave - the number of waves that exist over a specified distance. More formally, it is the reciprocal of the wavelength. It is also the magnitude of the wave vector. Light passing through different media keeps its frequency, but not its wavelength or wavenumber. The unit for wavenumber commonly used in spectroscopy is centimetre to power minus one, PER-CM, rather than metre to power minus one, PER-M.	http://qudt.org/vocab/unit/PER-M
quantitykind:Width	Width	"Width" is the middle of three dimensions: length, width, thickness.	http://qudt.org/vocab/unit/M
quantitykind:Work	Work	A force is said to do Work when it acts on a body so that there is a displacement of the point of application, however small, in the direction of the force.  The concepts of work and energy are closely tied to the concept of force because an applied force can do work on an object and cause a change in energy. Energy is defined as the ability to do work. Work is done on an object when an applied force moves it through a distance. Kinetic energy is the energy of an object in motion. The net work is equal to the change in kinetic energy.	http://qudt.org/vocab/unit/J http://qudt.org/vocab/unit/N-M
quantitykind:WorkFunction	Work Function	"Work Function" is the energy difference between an electron at rest at infinity and an electron at a certain energy level. The minimum energy (usually measured in electronvolts) needed to remove an electron from a solid to a point immediately outside the solid surface (or energy needed to move an electron from the Fermi level into vacuum).	http://qudt.org/vocab/unit/J
