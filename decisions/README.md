# Lightweight Architecture Decision Records #

## Context ##

*Lightweight Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)* are a technique for capturing important architectural decisions along with their context and consequences stored in a version control system for the benefit of future team members as well as for external oversight. Storing ADRs in version control systems are recommended as opposed to Wikis or a website so that they remain in sync with the code itself.

## Decision ##

1. When a design decision needs to be made about how to implement schema.org properly, an ADR will be stored in this repository in the decisions direcetory.

## Status ##

*Accepted*

## Consequences ##

As views on certain topics change over time, it will be difficult without ADRs to reflect on the context for a decision as it changes with respect to the code.
