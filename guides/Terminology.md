# Terminology
This discussion can be confusing if there is not some clarity on how terms are being used. Here are some definitions used in this discussion:
- Dataset:  A collection of data items unified by some criteria.
- Data item: a digital representation of some individual of interest, typically a structured set of attributes, but might include unstructured components like images, audio or video recording, or other documents.
- Attribute:  An individual element in a data item. Construed broadly to include those are "measured" in a conventional sense, and those whose values result from "assignment" or "classification". This corresponds to 'variable' or 'field', but we are using a different term to avoid connotation of a quantitative value.
- Type: A specification of the attibutes associated with a data item, along with rules for allowed low-level data types, formatting, value range, and cardinality. The schema for a data item. 
- Entity: a kind of thing in the world.
