### Schema.org Spatial

- https://schema.org/spatialCoverage
    - `Place` >> `GeoShape`
        - <strong>`box`</strong> - A rectangular (in lat-long space) extent specified by two points, the first in the lower left (southwest) corner and the second in the upper right (northeast) corner.
        - `circle`
        - `elevation`
        - `line`
        - <strong>`polygon`</strong> - A series of four or more points where the first and final points are identical.
    - `Place` >> `GeoCoordinates`
        - `latitude`
        - `longitude`
        - `elevation`
