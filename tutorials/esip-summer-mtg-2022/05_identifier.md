### Schema.org Identifier

- https://schema.org/identifier
    - <strong>`Text`
    - `URL`</strong>
    - `PropertyValue`


#### Identifiers as Text - Good


<pre>
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org/",
  <strong>"identifier": "doi:10.26008/1912/bco-dmo.775849.1"</strong>
}
</pre>

> **NOTE:** specifying "doi:" before the DOI value lets harvesters know that `10.26008/1912/bco-dmo.775849.1` is a DOI and not some other identifier type


#### Identifiers as URL - Better

<pre>
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org/",
  <strong>"identifier": "https://doi.org/10.26008/1912/bco-dmo.775849.1"</strong>
}
</pre>

### SameAs

- https://schema.org/sameAs
    - `URL`

> Inform the harvesters/search engines of other web pages that describe the same exact thing
> - So your page can be added as possible search results when the other page is found
> - Provides better information and context to web searchers
