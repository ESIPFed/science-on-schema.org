abstract: "Dissolved N2O concentrations from were measured in discrete samples on a research expedition to the Equatorial Pacific. Water samples were collected using a 24 bottle Niskin rosette equipped with a CTD. N₂O concentrations were measured using a headspace equilibration method and analyzed on a SRI Greenhouse Gas Monitoring Gas Chromatograph."
