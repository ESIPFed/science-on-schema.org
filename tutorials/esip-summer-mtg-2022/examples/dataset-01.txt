title: "Nitrous oxide concentrations from the R/V Falkor expedition FK160115 in the Central Pacific from January to February 2016"
url: "https://www.bco-dmo.org/dataset/775849"
abstract: "Dissolved N2O concentrations from were measured in discrete samples on a research expedition to the Equatorial Pacific. Water samples were collected using a 24 bottle Niskin rosette equipped with a CTD. Nâ‚‚O concentrations were measured using a headspace equilibration method and analyzed on a SRI Greenhouse Gas Monitoring Gas Chromatograph."
