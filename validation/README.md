# Validation

## About

This directory holds work related to graph validation.  The focus is on using the
W3C SHACL Recommendation (https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/).

At present we have worked up some examples around the Google Developers guidance at
https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/dataset#dataset.   However,
example focused on the Science on Schema, FAIR Data, DataONE or other community
principles would be welcome.  

## Resources

If you are looking for tools test SHACL shapes with you should look at the 
W3C Implementation Report (https://w3c.github.io/data-shapes/data-shapes-test-suite/).  
Two of the higer ranking tools are pySHACL (https://github.com/RDFLib/pySHACL)
and TopBraid (https://github.com/TopQuadrant/shacl)
